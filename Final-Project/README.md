ML x AM: Identifying Defects in 3D Prints with Machine Learning


Overview

This project focuses on detecting defects in additive manufcatured objects, specifically 3D printed, using machine learning. XGBoost is leveraged to identify defects using point cloud data, aiming to improve the quality control process in manufacturing.

Folders

models/: Contains the trained model saved as a .pkl file.

plots/: Contains visualizations generated during model evaluation (e.g., confusion matrix, feature importance).

results/: Contains evaluation metrics and results saved as text files.

src/: Contains the source code files for different stages of the project (e.g., preprocessing, training, and evaluation).

Results

The FinalProject.ipynb file contains the complete code, analysis, and results of the project. For organizational purposes and code submission requirements, the results, trained models, and visualizations are also saved in separate folders within the project structure.

models/: Contains the saved model (best_xgb_model.pkl).

plots/: Contains all visualizations generated during evaluation.

results/: Contains evaluation metrics and confusion matrices in metrics.txt.

You can refer to FinalProject.ipynb for a comprehensive view of the project. The other folders help organize specific outputs for ease of access.
